Being marginalized as confused and being told to choose a side has affected how I \"label\" myself; I say I'm gay af or pretty damn gay over saying bi because I don't want to spend time explaining to everyone why I'm 100% bi and not confused.

For example, if we raffle an alien for charity, this could gain us web3 news exposure and raise money for a relevant charity at the same time.  \n\nIt isn't just about my ideas, though, and I will also be doing due diligence on the proposals of others, with a focus on getting more LGBTQ+ members into the community, ideally in a way that seems both equitable and ambitious.",
